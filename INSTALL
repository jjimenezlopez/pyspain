Thanks for downloading pyspain.                                                   

Run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "pyspain" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.7)
    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.5)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)
